Version: 2.0.24
Date: 2025-04-24
  Changes:
    - bump version to not collide with beta test version
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.23
Date: 2025-04-24
  Changes:
    - changes the strategy to insert Cybersyn schedules from "before the permanent depot entry" to "after interrupt entries". This way add_refueler_schedule does not need to concern itself with direct-to-depot entries.
    - added a command cybersyn-recalculate-train-size to recalculate all trains and I've added the function on on_configuration_changed
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.22
Date: 2025-04-11

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.20
Date: 2025-03-16
  Changes:
    - Added separate request threshold for all fluids. It supersedes the request threshold when set and is it self superseded by a specific threshold for a fluid
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.19
Date: 2025-02-24
  Bugfixes:
    - wagon controls now output fluid signals
    - GUI crash when some signals were recipes instead of items
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.18
Date: 2025-02-06
  Changes:
    - Adds a new virtual signal: reserved fluid capacity per wagon. When this virtual signal is sent to a provider's station combinator, it will cause incoming fluid trains to subtract the value of the signal from the capacity of each wagon when creating a manifest. This is the rough equivalent of "locked slots" behavior for fluids.
  Bugfixes:

Version: 1.2.14
Date: 2023-4-30
  Features:
    - Added opt-in WIP trains, inventory, and station manager gui (highly experimental, use at your own risk)
  Changes:
    - The automatic allow list now consistently looks 3 tiles down the first curved rail it finds along a station for inserters or pumps. Previously it would conditionally look only 1 tile down. This should lead to more intuitive allow list behaviour for stations with trains that park slightly on curved rails.

    - Provider override thresholds now correctly override the required train capacity as well; fix contributed by shopt
    - Fixed a rare crash relating to an uninitialized network mask on a new station

    - Added an incompatibility error with picker dollies, proper compatibility to come in a later update
    - Fixed entities not having the correct names in nullius contributed by Sharparam

  Changes:
