Version: 1.2.15
Date: 2023-4-30

Version: 1.2.14
Date: 2023-4-30
  Features:
    - Added opt-in WIP trains, inventory, and station manager gui (highly experimental, use at your own risk)
  Changes:
    - The automatic allow list now consistently looks 3 tiles down the first curved rail it finds along a station for inserters or pumps. Previously it would conditionally look only 1 tile down. This should lead to more intuitive allow list behaviour for stations with trains that park slightly on curved rails.
  Bugfixes:
    - Provider override thresholds now correctly override the required train capacity as well; fix contributed by shopt
    - Fixed a rare crash relating to an uninitialized network mask on a new station
    - Fixed a SE space elevator bug that caused incorrect orders when the provider and requester station had the same name
    - Added an incompatibility error with picker dollies, proper compatibility to come in a later update
    - Fixed entities not having the correct names in nullius contributed by Sharparam

  Changes:
    - Inverted the sign of combinator outputs, a map setting has been added to maintain backwards compatibility with <=1.2.1 worlds

    - Forced provide stations to wait until they can service the highest priority request station
    - Provide stations now override request thresholds with the per-item thresholds set by their station control combinator

    - Added more detailed missing train alerts
  Changes:
    - The internal blueprint storage for cybernetic combinators was changed for the sake of future-proofing it for adding more combinator settings to the mod, this unfortunately breaks some existing blueprints
